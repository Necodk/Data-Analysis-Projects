# Looker Studio Dashboard Project

This project features an advertising performance dashboard created in Looker Studio, which provides insights into various advertising metrics over time. Key metrics include ad spend, return on marketing investment (ROMI), click-through rate (CTR), cost per click (CPC), and conversion rates across different campaigns.

## Project Overview

This dashboard presents a comprehensive view of advertising performance over time. It allows stakeholders to track campaign effectiveness, understand spending patterns, and evaluate the return on marketing investment (ROMI) for different advertising strategies.

## Dashboard Visualizations

### 1. Ad Spend and ROMI by Month

This line chart visualizes the monthly ad spend and ROMI, showing how investment and return vary over time. Peaks and valleys indicate periods of high and low investment efficiency.

### 2. Campaign Performance Metrics

This table summarizes key performance indicators (KPIs) across campaigns, including:
- **Ad Spend**: Total spent on each campaign.
- **CPM**: Cost per thousand impressions.
- **CTR**: Click-through rate.
- **CPC**: Cost per click.
- **ROMI**: Return on marketing investment.

Top campaigns by performance, such as "Wholesale" and "Trendy," are highlighted for their high CTR and ROMI, while others, like "Expansion," show significant spending with varying efficiency.

### 3. Total Clicks and Impressions

This section includes aggregate metrics:
- **Total Clicks**: 636.9K
- **Total Impressions**: 70.7M
- **Total Spend**: $28.6M
- **Total Revenue**: $34.9M
- **Conversion Rate**: 2,967 (indicating conversion events).

### 4. Monthly Campaign Counts

A bar chart tracks the number of active campaigns each month, revealing trends in campaign activity and engagement. Periods with higher campaign counts show intense promotional efforts, while quieter months reflect fewer active campaigns.

## Key Metrics

- **Total Ad Spend**: $28.6 million
- **Total Revenue**: $34.9 million
- **ROMI**: Calculated across campaigns to assess effectiveness.
- **Total Clicks**: 636.9K clicks across all campaigns.
- **Total Impressions**: 70.7 million
- **Conversion Events**: 2,967 events

## Insights

1. **Spending and ROMI Trends**:
   - Monthly ad spend and ROMI fluctuations indicate that some periods achieve higher returns relative to investment, suggesting effective promotional timing.

2. **High-Performing Campaigns**:
   - The campaigns "Wholesale," "Trendy," and "Discounts" show high ROMI and CTR, making them strong candidates for increased investment.

3. **Optimizing Underperforming Campaigns**:
   - Campaigns with high spend but low ROMI, like "Expansion," could be analyzed further for potential improvements in targeting or ad content.

4. **Conversion Efficiency**:
   - The conversion rate shows room for improvement; strategies to enhance ad targeting or optimize landing pages could increase conversion events.

## Conclusion

The Looker Studio dashboard provides valuable insights into ad spend effectiveness, campaign performance, and overall advertising ROI. By focusing on high-ROI campaigns and optimizing underperforming ones, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to maximize marketing impact.
