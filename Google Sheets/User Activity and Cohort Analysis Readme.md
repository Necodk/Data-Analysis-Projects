# User Activity and Cohort Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing user activity, retention, and demographics in a mobile application. The analysis includes cohort retention, DAU/WAU metrics, user demographics, device model usage, and engagement trends over time.

## Overview

This project provides insights into user behavior and activity trends. The analysis includes:
1. **Cohort Retention Analysis**: Examines user retention by tracking cohorts over multiple months.
2. **DAU/WAU and Engagement Trends**: Measures Daily Active Users (DAU) and Weekly Active Users (WAU) to understand user engagement.
3. **User Demographics**: Analyzes the age distribution and language preferences among users.
4. **Device Model Analysis**: Identifies the usage of older device models in the user base.
5. **Unique User Engagement**: Tracks the number of unique active users over time to monitor user retention.

## Data Visualizations

### 1. Cohort Retention Analysis

The cohort table shows user retention over time, with color-coded values indicating retention percentages for each month following the initial activity. This helps visualize the drop-off rates and retention patterns for different user groups.

### 2. DAU/WAU and Engagement Trends

The DAU and WAU graph visualizes weekly active users and the DAU-to-WAU ratio, giving insights into user engagement trends. Additionally, a polynomial trendline is used to show the growth pattern in WAU over time.

### 3. User Demographics

This chart shows the distribution of user languages and device model age. The data highlights the user language preferences (e.g., `uk`, `ru`, `en`) and the proportion of users using older device models.

### 4. Unique User Engagement

The unique user retention graph shows the monthly count of unique users and how many continue to engage with the app over time. The chart displays a decreasing trend, indicating how user engagement declines as months progress.

## Key Insights

1. **Retention Trends**: 
   - The cohort retention analysis shows a steep decline in user retention after the initial months, with retention rates stabilizing after the first few months.

2. **DAU/WAU Ratio**:
   - The DAU/WAU metric suggests an increase in weekly engagement over time, but the ratio indicates potential room for growth in daily engagement.

3. **User Demographics**:
   - The majority of users are from the `uk` region, with a significant number of users speaking `ru`.
   - Only a small portion of the user base uses older device models, which could influence performance and app compatibility considerations.

4. **Unique User Retention**:
   - The number of unique active users shows a decline over time, with most users active in the first few months and a consistent decrease in activity thereafter.

## Recommendations

1. **Retention Improvements**:
   - To improve retention, consider introducing re-engagement campaigns targeted at users within their first few months.
   - Offering incentives such as discounts, reminders, or new content can encourage users to remain active beyond the initial months.

2. **Increase Daily Engagement**:
   - Analyze user feedback and app usage patterns to enhance daily engagement and activity. Adding daily tasks, rewards, or challenges may boost the DAU/WAU ratio.

3. **Device and Language Customization**:
   - Optimize the app for users in the `uk` and `ru` regions, as they constitute the majority of the user base. Additionally, ensure the app performs well on older device models to prevent potential churn.

4. **Monitor Unique User Activity**:
   - Track unique user trends monthly to identify any significant drop-offs or patterns, and address potential issues that may be causing users to disengage.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights areas for improvement in user retention, engagement, and targeted regional strategies. By implementing re-engagement campaigns, focusing on daily engagement, and tailoring the app experience for specific user demographics, the app can improve its user retention and engagement metrics.
