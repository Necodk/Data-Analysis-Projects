# Game Metrics Analysis


This project analyzes key metrics for three mobile games to understand their performance in terms of user acquisition, monetization, and audience demographics. It also explores possible strategies to improve conversion rates and average revenue per paying user (ARPPU).

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns for three games (Game 1, Game 2, Game 3):
- **Ad Spend**: Total amount spent on advertising.
- **Total Users Count**: Number of users who downloaded or accessed the game.
- **Total Revenue**: Total revenue generated from the game.
- **Paid Users Count**: Number of users who made a purchase.
- **CR to Paid**: Conversion rate from free to paying users.
- **ARPPU**: Average Revenue Per Paying User.
- **Age Statistics**: Includes average age, median age, minimum age, and maximum age of users.

## Metrics Analyzed

1. **Ad Spend**: The budget allocated to advertising each game.
2. **Conversion Rate to Paid (CR to Paid)**: Percentage of total users who converted to paying customers.
3. **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Average revenue generated per paying user.
4. **Age Demographics**: Analyzes the average, median, minimum, and maximum age of users.

## Key Findings

1. **Conversion Rate (CR to Paid)**:
   - **Game 1 and Game 2** have significantly lower CR to Paid compared to Game 3. Game 1 has not allocated any budget to advertising, while Game 2 has an underdeveloped ad strategy in certain regions (specifically 'ru' region).
   - **Game 3** has achieved a high CR to Paid due to effective ad spend allocation, particularly in regions such as the UK and Russia.

2. **ARPPU Differences**:
   - Game 3 has the highest ARPPU among the games, attributed to its targeted advertising strategy and longer time on the market.
   - Game 1 and Game 2, which have shorter times on the market and lower ad spend, show significantly lower ARPPU.

3. **Age Demographics**:
   - Average user age varies slightly across the games, with Game 1 having a younger average user base and Game 3 attracting users with a broader age range.

## Hypotheses and Recommendations

1. **Why might the CR to Paid conversion rate be lower for Games 1 and 2?**
   - The lower conversion rates for Games 1 and 2 can be attributed to inadequate ad spending and ineffective targeting strategies.

2. **What could explain the difference in ARPPU between the games?**
   - ARPPU differences are influenced by advertising strategies and game release dates. Game 3's established presence and robust ad strategy have contributed to its higher ARPPU.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - To test hypotheses on ad strategies and release timing, itâ€™s recommended to implement enhancements in ad spending and observe the effects iteratively.

4. **Recommendations for Game 2**:
   - Increase ad spending in targeted regions like 'ru' and 'uk' to build a more effective advertising strategy.
   - Prioritize in-game improvements based on user feedback to enhance user experience and potentially boost conversion rates.

## Conclusion

The analysis suggests that targeted ad spending and strategic release timing play a crucial role in driving higher conversion rates and ARPPU. Game 2 has potential for growth by improving its ad strategy and responding to user feedback, which could align its performance more closely with that of Game 3.
