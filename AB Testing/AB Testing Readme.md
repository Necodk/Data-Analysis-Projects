# A/B Testing Report

This repository contains a detailed report on an A/B testing experiment, aiming to evaluate the impact of specific changes or features on key user metrics.

## Overview

The A/B Testing report in this repository explores the methodology, analysis, and outcomes of an experiment designed to compare two user groups (Group A and Group B) and their interaction with a particular feature or change. 

### Contents of the Report
The report includes the following sections:
- **Hypothesis**: Definition of the experimental hypothesis.
- **Experiment Design**: Details on how the test was set up, including:
  - Sample selection criteria
  - Randomization process
  - Metrics tracked to determine success
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis used to evaluate the experiment results, including:
  - Metrics comparison between groups
  - Statistical significance tests
- **Results and Insights**: Key findings from the test, interpretation of data, and implications of the observed results.

The PDF report is available in this repository under the filename `A-B_Testing.pdf`.

## Tests Conducted

The A/B Testing report includes detailed descriptions of specific tests conducted to assess the feature's impact on user behavior. Key tests and methodologies applied in the report are:

1. **Hypothesis Testing**: A hypothesis is formulated to predict the effect of the tested feature on user engagement or conversion rates.
2. **Experiment Design**: The test setup involves dividing users into a control group (Group A) and a variation group (Group B), with clear randomization criteria.
3. **Metrics Comparison**: Key user metrics, such as engagement and conversion rates, are measured and compared across groups.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical methods are used to determine the significance of observed differences between the control and variation groups, validating the impact of the feature.

These tests focus on identifying statistically significant impacts, providing actionable insights for future product decisions.

## Key Findings

The A/B Testing analysis provides insights into:
- Changes in user behavior or engagement due to the tested feature.
- Statistical significance and practical relevance of the results.
- Recommendations based on observed data trends.

## How to Use This Report

The document can be used as a reference for understanding A/B testing methodologies, statistical testing processes, and interpreting results in a business context. The findings may also be useful for making data-informed decisions on product features or user interface changes.
