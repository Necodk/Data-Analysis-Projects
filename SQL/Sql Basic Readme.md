# SQL Basics Project

This project contains a collection of basic SQL queries designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts and techniques in SQL. The file `Sql_Basic.sql` includes examples of data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and other essential SQL operations.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide foundational SQL queries that can be used to understand basic data manipulation and retrieval techniques. These queries cover a range of SQL operations that are commonly used in data analysis and database management.

## Contents of `Sql_Basic.sql`

- **Data Retrieval**: Queries to select and retrieve data from tables.
- **Filtering Data**: Using `WHERE` clauses to filter data based on specific conditions.
- **Sorting Results**: Ordering results using `ORDER BY`.
- **Aggregating Data**: Applying functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to summarize data.
- **Grouping Data**: Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering grouped results with `HAVING`.
- **Joining Tables**: Combining data from multiple tables using `JOIN` operations.

## Usage

1. Load the SQL file (`Sql_Basic.sql`) into your SQL database environment.
2. Execute each query sequentially to observe the results and understand the SQL operations.
3. Modify the queries as needed to apply them to different datasets or database schemas.

## Example Use Cases

- **Data Analysis**: Retrieve and aggregate data for basic analytical tasks.
- **Database Management**: Understand core SQL commands to interact with and manage database content.
- **Learning SQL**: Ideal for beginners looking to grasp foundational SQL concepts and query structure.
