# Python Data Collection Project

This project involves collecting data using Python, leveraging various libraries and methods for data extraction, processing, and storage. The Jupyter Notebook `Python_CollectingData.ipynb` contains all relevant code and documentation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate effective data collection techniques in Python. The notebook walks through the steps for extracting, cleaning, and storing data, which can be applied to various data sources and use cases.

## Notebook Contents

- **Data Collection**: Methods for retrieving data from APIs, web scraping, or loading from files.
- **Data Cleaning**: Steps for handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and data transformation.
- **Data Storage**: Approaches for storing data in databases, CSV files, or other formats.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:
- `requests`: For API calls
- `BeautifulSoup`: For web scraping
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and storage
- `json` and `csv`: For handling data formats

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run each cell sequentially to see the data collection and processing steps.
3. Modify any parameters as needed for different data sources or formats.

## Example Outputs

- **DataFrames**: Cleaned data displayed in pandas DataFrames.
- **CSV/JSON Files**: Data saved in CSV or JSON format for easy access and further analysis.
- **Database Storage**: Optional database storage code for larger datasets.
