# Python Data Collection with Pandas

This project demonstrates data collection and processing techniques in Python using Pandas. The Jupyter Notebook `Python_DCwithPandas.ipynb` contains the necessary code for data extraction, 
cleaning, and storage in various formats.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to showcase data collection methods and data manipulation using Pandas. The notebook walks through the steps for gathering, cleaning, and storing data,
which are essential for data analysis and preprocessing.

## Notebook Contents

- **Data Collection**: Methods for retrieving data from APIs or loading from CSV/JSON files.
- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques for handling missing values, removing duplicates, and data formatting.
- **Data Storage**: Saving processed data to CSV, JSON, or database formats for easy access and analysis.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run each cell sequentially to follow the data collection, cleaning, and storage steps.
3. Modify the parameters to adapt to different datasets or formats as needed.

## Example Outputs

- **DataFrames**: Display of cleaned data using Pandas DataFrames.
- **CSV/JSON Files**: Data saved in CSV or JSON format for further analysis.
- **Database Storage**: Optional storage solutions for larger datasets.
